"""
Reference migrations for Auth Kit FastAPI.

These are reference migration scripts that consumers can copy and adapt
for their own projects. Auth Kit uses SQLAlchemy's create_all() for
auto-creating tables, but production projects may need proper migrations.

Usage:
    Copy the relevant migration files to your project's alembic/versions/
    directory and update the revision IDs appropriately.
